# MyFirstWeb
Project: MyFirstWeb – Blogging Frontend (KIT202 Assignment 1)
This project was developed as part of KIT202 Web Programming Fundamentals at the University of Tasmania. The goal of this assignment was to build the frontend of a basic blogging web application using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

The blog website features multiple static pages with user interface elements that simulate the core functionality of a blog, including:

🏠 Homepage displaying the 4 most recent posts

📚 Archive page listing older blog posts with toggled full-content display

🔐 Login page with form validation and a register link

📝 Registration form with validation and password policy enforcement

✍️ Create Post page for drafting new posts

👥 About page introducing the team and listing references for external assets
